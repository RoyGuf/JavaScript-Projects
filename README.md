# JavaScript-Projects

Hi there,
Those are my very first JavaScripts/ Html/ css projects.
Each folder represent a single project, build with JQuery, including .js .html .css files, except fot the 'Bootstrap' folder and React/Angular folders.

The 'Bootstrap' folder must be at the same containing folder of the project folder for css config.

The React and the Angular folders represents a React.js projects and an Angular.js projects. 

Hope you will enjoy my work :)
